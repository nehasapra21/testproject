                            <p> Fake news or not: The truth behind the veil
                                Telling stories has been the favourite pastime activity around the world. In India,
                                storytelling
                                has
                                had several formats like katha, puppetry, fables, paintings, cinema, theatre and
                                books, among
                                others. These formats have evolved and adapted themselves as per people’s choices
                                and needs over
                                the
                                years. But, the fastest and the most dramatic evolution has happened after the
                                advent of the
                                internet.
                            </p>
                            <p> The internet brought with it the many possibilities, the many more modes of
                                storytelling and the
                                fostering of conversations through social media platforms. For people who had only
                                known
                                speaking
                                face to face before this, or at the most telephonic interactions, suddenly found
                                ways of
                                connecting
                                with hundreds and millions of people out there, cutting across geographies and
                                cultures.
                                First audio and then video, people’s faces began popping up on screens. As
                                technology grew
                                fancier,
                                so did avenues and possibilities of communication. Then came mobile phones. We all
                                remember how
                                in
                                our childhood, we had to stand in long queues at the STDs/PCOs, to be able to share
                                the news
                                with
                                our loved ones. And then, we all remember how Orkut – the “opium” of the internet –
                                hooked us
                                all to
                                it deeply. Slowly, the possibilities increased and the power of digital media
                                transformed, quite
                                literally, everything around us. One after another, several social media platforms
                                were
                                developed
                                and over time, they evolved. They kept evolving until every single user of the
                                mobile phone had
                                the
                                world on his/her fingertips. Today, most of us wake up to the “good morning”
                                messages and
                                notifications from at least half a dozen social media applications on our phones.

                            <p> Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and Instagram, not necessarily in the same order, have
                                become medium
                                of
                                all sorts of information and news; news which could be true or news which could be
                                false. Along
                                with
                                connecting friends, couples, families and businesses around the world, these
                                applications have
                                brought with them the power of one-to-many communication. With a mobile phone in
                                their hands and
                                24*7 internet connectivity, technology has made man a “digital” animal. Knowingly
                                and
                                unknowingly,
                                we have all become newsmongers in our own little ways. But how much of what we read,
                                share and
                                preach is actually real? Today, as we consume several gigabytes of data everyday,
                                what if some
                                or
                                all of what we read is not even real?
                            </p>
                            <p> Fake news or “deliberate” misinformation is an evil of digital media. It is caused
                                by the
                                people, of
                                the people, for the people. Junk, pseudo, propaganda or hoax, whatever you may call
                                it, fake
                                news
                                has become commonplace. So much so that the lines between the “real” and the “reel”
                                have
                                completely
                                blurred, and the outcomes have started frightening the nation. Digital media has
                                given the
                                inherent
                                human trait – gossiping – a channel. But the aftermath of few gossips has left
                                people gasping
                                for
                                truth. Over the past few years, the spread of fake news has led to violence, mass
                                protests,
                                mob-lynching, polarisation and murders in large numbers. It has been the very
                                premise of
                                multiple
                                attacks, killings and crime in recent years. Today, the e-janta scrolls, shares and
                                spreads
                                without
                                verifying. How much of it are you consuming? Let’s find out!
